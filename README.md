## My process

- Wanted to use this challenge as a practice for flexbox concepts
- Created desktop page first, whereas on hindsight - should have created mobile page first.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (As much as possible)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned


#### css

- Learned by experimenting with card container and manupulating elements within them via flexbox.


### Continued development

- Would probably retry this challenge using React in future.
